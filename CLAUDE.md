# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fuzzy's Home School is an educational platform with AI tutoring, gamified learning, and AR/QR Colonial Zone exploration. It's a monorepo using Turbo, with Next.js 14 for the web app, Supabase for backend, and DeepSeek AI for intelligent tutoring.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always read `DO_NOT_CHANGE.md` before making any architectural changes. This file documents intentional decisions that should NOT be modified.**

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Development server (port 3000) - run from root or apps/web
npm run dev

# Build for production (runs validation checks first)
npm run build

# Preview deployment
npm run preview

# Production deployment
npm run ship

# Check deployment status
npm run status

# Rollback deployment
npm run rollback

# Start production server (from apps/web)
cd apps/web && npm run start

cd apps/web && npm run typecheck

# Code formatting (from apps/web)
cd apps/web && npm run format
cd apps/web && npm run format:check

# Clean build artifacts (from apps/web)
cd apps/web && npm run clean

# E2E testing with Playwright (from root)
npx playwright test
npx playwright test --ui        # With UI
npx playwright test --headed    # In headed mode
npx playwright test --debug     # Debug mode

# IMPORTANT: Use make commands for safe deployment
make validate      # Run pre-deployment checks
make deploy        # Safe production deployment
make sync          # Sync env vars to Vercel
make check-env     # Check environment status
make setup-env     # Initial environment setup
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
make reset         # Full reset (use with caution)
```

## üîí DEPLOYMENT PROTECTION SYSTEM

### Critical Pre-Deployment Checklist
```bash
# ALWAYS run these before deploying:
1. make validate    # Validates ALL requirements
2. make sync        # Syncs env vars to Vercel
3. make deploy      # Safe deployment with checks
```

### Required Environment Variables
ALL these variables MUST be set in both .env.local and Vercel:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (server-side)
- `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret for auth

### Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/validate-deployment.sh` - Validates everything
- `scripts/sync-env-to-vercel.sh` - Syncs env vars
- `Makefile` - All deployment commands

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
make emergency-fix   # Bypass checks (emergency only)
make check-env       # Check current status
make setup-env       # Reset environment
```
