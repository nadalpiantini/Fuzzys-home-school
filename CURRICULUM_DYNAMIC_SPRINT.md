# 🧠 Curriculum Dinámico - Sprint Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Successfully implemented a dynamic curriculum system with:
- ✅ Automatic chapter unlocking based on performance
- ✅ Cross-subject recommendations
- ✅ Interactive curriculum map (Skill Tree visualization)
- ✅ Real-time progress integration

---

## 📁 Files Created

### Database Migrations

#### 1. `db/migrations/06_curriculum_paths.sql`
**Purpose**: Core curriculum structure with nodes and links

**Tables Created**:
- `curriculum_nodes` - Represents chapters with metadata (difficulty, subject, age_range)
- `curriculum_links` - Defines relationships between chapters with unlock conditions
- `student_unlocked_paths` - Tracks which chapters each student has unlocked

**Key Features**:
- Flexible condition system: `always`, `score>=70`, `score>=90`, `avg<60`, `completed`
- Link types: `linear`, `alternative`, `reinforcement`
- Full RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Automatic timestamp management

#### 2. `db/migrations/07_cross_subject_recommendations.sql`
**Purpose**: Intelligent cross-subject recommendations

**Views Created**:
- `v_cross_recommendations` - Identifies weak areas and suggests complementary subjects
- `v_recommended_chapters` - Recommends next chapters based on performance

**Functions Created**:
- `get_learning_path(student_id, curriculum_id, limit)` - Returns personalized learning path

**Logic**:
- Math struggling → suggests literacy fundamentals
- Literacy struggling → suggests math basics
- Science struggling → suggests both math and literacy
- Requires 2+ attempts with <60% avg to trigger recommendations

### Integration Points

#### 1. StoryLesson.tsx
**Location**: `apps/web/src/components/lesson/StoryLesson.tsx`

**Integration**: Added unlock logic in `handleActivityComplete` function

**When**: After chapter completion (last activity of chapter)

**What it does**:
1. Calls `/api/curriculum/unlock` with score
2. Receives unlocked chapters list
3. Shows toast notification with unlocked chapter titles
4. Logs unlock data to console

**Code Addition** (lines 552-579):
```typescript
if (chapterCompleted) {
  // 🔓 Unlock next chapters based on performance
  try {
    const unlockResponse = await fetch('/api/curriculum/unlock', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        studentId: childData?.id,
        curriculumId: curriculum.id,
        chapterId: currentChapter.id,
        score: activityScore,
      }),
    });

    const unlockResult = await unlockResponse.json();

    if (unlockResult.ok && unlockResult.unlocked?.length > 0) {
      const unlockedTitles = unlockResult.unlocked.map((u: any) => u.title).join(', ');
      toast.success(`🎉 ¡Nuevos capítulos desbloqueados!`, {
        description: unlockedTitles,
        duration: 5000,
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error unlocking chapters:', error);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Parent Dashboard
**Location**: `apps/web/src/app/parent/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Integration**: Added `<CrossRecommendations>` component

**When**: Displayed for each student in the tabs

**What it shows**:
- Weak subject areas with cross-subject suggestions
- Recommended next chapters based on performance
- Priority-based recommendations

**Code Addition** (line 407):
```typescript
{/* Cross-Subject Recommendations */}
<CrossRecommendations studentId={student.studentId} />
```

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

### Student Journey

1. **Complete Chapter**
   - Student finishes all activities in a chapter
   - System calculates final score

2. **Automatic Unlock Evaluation**
   - System checks all outgoing links from completed chapter
   - Evaluates each condition:
     - `always` → Always unlock
     - `score>=70` → Unlock if score ≥ 70
     - `score>=90` → Unlock if score ≥ 90
     - `avg<60` → Unlock remedial path if struggling
     - `avg>=85` → Unlock challenge path if excelling

3. **Unlock Notification**
   - Toast notification shows newly unlocked chapters
   - Different paths may unlock based on performance

4. **Progress Visualization**
   - Visit `/learn/map` to see interactive skill tree
   - Green nodes: Completed
   - Blue nodes: Available to play
   - Gray nodes: Locked (prerequisites not met)

5. **Recommendations**
   - Parent dashboard shows cross-subject recommendations
   - Suggests complementary subjects based on weak areas
   - Prioritized by urgency (high/medium/low)

## 🔧 Configuration Examples

### Example Curriculum Setup

```sql
-- Create nodes for a math curriculum
INSERT INTO curriculum_nodes (curriculum_id, chapter_id, title, difficulty, subject, order_index) VALUES
('math-level1', 'ch-1', 'Números 0-10', 'easy', 'math', 1),
('math-level1', 'ch-2', 'Números 11-20', 'medium', 'math', 2),
('math-level1', 'ch-2-alt', 'Números Avanzados', 'hard', 'math', 3),
('math-level1', 'ch-2-remedial', 'Repaso Números Básicos', 'easy', 'math', 4);

-- Create linear progression
INSERT INTO curriculum_links (from_node, to_node, condition, type) VALUES
(
  (SELECT id FROM curriculum_nodes WHERE chapter_id = 'ch-1'),
  (SELECT id FROM curriculum_nodes WHERE chapter_id = 'ch-2'),
  'score>=70',
  'linear'
);

-- Create alternative path for high performers
INSERT INTO curriculum_links (from_node, to_node, condition, type) VALUES
(
  (SELECT id FROM curriculum_nodes WHERE chapter_id = 'ch-1'),
  (SELECT id FROM curriculum_nodes WHERE chapter_id = 'ch-2-alt'),
  'score>=90',
  'alternative'
);

-- Create remedial path for struggling students
INSERT INTO curriculum_links (from_node, to_node, condition, type) VALUES
(
  (SELECT id FROM curriculum_nodes WHERE chapter_id = 'ch-1'),
  (SELECT id FROM curriculum_nodes WHERE chapter_id = 'ch-2-remedial'),
  'avg<60',
  'reinforcement'
);
```

### Unlock Condition Options

| Condition | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `always` | Always unlock next chapter | Linear progression |

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Unlock Patterns**
   - Which conditions trigger most often?
   - How many students take alternative vs linear paths?
   - Average time to unlock next chapter

2. **Recommendation Effectiveness**
   - Do cross-subject recommendations improve weak areas?
   - Completion rate of recommended chapters
   - Score improvement after following recommendations

3. **Path Analysis**
   - Most popular alternative paths
   - Success rate by path type (linear/alternative/reinforcement)
   - Student retention on different path types

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Most common unlock conditions
SELECT condition, type, COUNT(*) as unlock_count
FROM curriculum_links cl
JOIN student_unlocked_paths sup ON cl.to_node = sup.curriculum_id
GROUP BY condition, type
ORDER BY unlock_count DESC;

-- Students using alternative paths
SELECT student_id, COUNT(*) as alt_paths_taken
FROM student_unlocked_paths
WHERE unlocked_via IN (
  SELECT chapter_id FROM curriculum_links WHERE type = 'alternative'
)
GROUP BY student_id
ORDER BY alt_paths_taken DESC;

-- Cross-subject recommendation success
SELECT
  weak_subject,
  suggested_subjects,
  COUNT(*) as students_with_recommendation,
  AVG(avg_score) as avg_weak_score
FROM v_cross_recommendations
GROUP BY weak_subject, suggested_subjects;
```
