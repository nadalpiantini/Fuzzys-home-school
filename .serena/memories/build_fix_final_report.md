# Build Fix Final Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed all TypeScript compilation errors across the tRPC routers and application code. The build now passes TypeScript compilation, but still encounters styled-jsx SSR issues during error page prerendering.

## Completed Fixes

### ✅ TypeScript Compilation Fixed
1. **tRPC Router Context Issues**: Fixed all routers to use proper context typing with SupabaseClient
   - adaptiveRouter.ts: Added context type and fixed error handling
   - assignmentRouter.ts: Fixed all `supabase` to `ctx.supabase`  
   - educationalRouter.ts: Added context, fixed nested router, removed SQL template literals
   - liveGameRouter.ts: Added context type
   - All routers now properly typed with `SupabaseClient` context

2. **Error Pages**: Converted to use client-side rendering
   - 404.tsx: Changed to 'use client', fixed javascript: hrefs
   - 500.tsx: Changed to 'use client', fixed javascript: hrefs
   - Added global-error.tsx for global error handling

3. **Component Issues**: Fixed import and type errors
   - /student/tutor/page.tsx: Removed deprecated imports, fixed session types

## Remaining Issue

### ❌ styled-jsx SSR React Context Error
The styled-jsx library (v5.1.1, transitive dependency of Next.js 14) continues to cause React context errors during SSR prerendering of error pages.

**Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')`
**Location**: StyleRegistry component from styled-jsx
**Affected Pages**: All error pages (404, 500) across locales

## Attempted Solutions That Didn't Work
1. Compiler configuration to disable styled-jsx
2. Webpack aliases to replace styled-jsx with mock
3. Converting error pages to client-side rendering

## Root Cause Analysis
- styled-jsx is a Next.js internal dependency that can't be fully disabled
- The issue occurs specifically during SSR prerendering phase
- No actual styled-jsx usage in user code (no `<style jsx>` patterns found)

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Quick Fix)
1. **Skip prerendering for error pages**: Add to next.config.js:
   ```javascript
   generateStaticParams: async () => []
   ```
   for error pages

2. **Use production environment variable**: 
   ```bash
   NEXT_PRIVATE_SKIP_ERROR_PAGE_PRERENDERING=true npm run build
   ```

### Long-term (Proper Fix)
1. **Upgrade Next.js**: Consider upgrading to Next.js 14.1+ where this issue may be resolved
2. **Alternative**: Downgrade to Next.js 13.5.x if upgrade is not feasible
3. **Remove Sentry temporarily**: The Sentry integration may be contributing to the issue

## Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ PASSING
- **Linting**: ✅ PASSING  
- **Static Generation**: ❌ FAILING (error pages only)
- **Core Application**: ✅ WORKING (all non-error pages build successfully)

## Files Modified
- apps/web/next.config.js (webpack config, compiler settings)
- apps/web/src/lib/trpc/routers/*.ts (all router files fixed)
- apps/web/src/app/404.tsx, 500.tsx (converted to client rendering)
- apps/web/src/app/global-error.tsx (created)
- apps/web/src/app/student/tutor/page.tsx (fixed imports and types)

## Next Steps
The core application functionality is intact. The build failure is isolated to error page prerendering. Consider:
1. Deploying with `NEXT_PRIVATE_SKIP_ERROR_PAGE_PRERENDERING=true`
2. Or upgrading/downgrading Next.js version
3. Or temporarily removing error page prerendering until a proper fix is found
