# Vercel Build Final Solution Attempt

## Changes Made
1. Removed standalone output mode from next.config.js (was causing Vercel issues)
2. Updated Next.js from 14.0.4 to 14.2.21
3. Fixed TypeScript errors in external/page.tsx and quest/[id]/page.tsx
4. Created custom error pages in pages directory to bypass styled-jsx
5. Removed getServerSideProps from error pages (not allowed)
6. Removed conflicting error pages from app directory

## Current Status
- Build still failing locally on error page generation
- styled-jsx issue persists despite attempts
- Error: Export encountered errors on /404 and /500 paths

## Next Steps
Push changes to Vercel and see if their build environment handles it better, as the issue might be local-specific with the monorepo structure.
