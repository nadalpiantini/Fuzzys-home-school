# Webpack/TypeScript Compilation Error Fixed

## Issue
The AITutorChat component had a type error when calling `engine.startSession()`. The method expected a complete `studentProfile` object with required properties, but only `grade` and `learningStyle` were being provided.

## Solution
Updated the `startSession` call in AITutorChat.tsx to include all required properties:
- `currentLevel: 'beginner'`
- `strongAreas: []`
- `challengeAreas: []`

## File Modified
`/apps/web/src/components/tutor/AITutorChat.tsx` - Line 79-85

## Status
TypeScript compilation error resolved. The build should now complete successfully.
