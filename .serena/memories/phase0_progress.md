## ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

### 4. Teacher Dashboard Navigation
- **Finding**: Navigation routes exist and are properly configured
- **Pages Available**: /teacher/classes, /teacher/content, /teacher/analytics, /teacher/settings
- **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:3001

## ðŸ“‹ PENDING (7 tasks remaining)

5. Implement tRPC class management procedures
6. Complete Class Management CRUD operations
7. Implement AI Tutor chat functionality
8. Integrate DeepSeek API for AI responses
9. Test all implemented features
10. Fix bugs and polish UI
11. Validate build and deployment readiness

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

The navigation appears to be working from the code perspective. The router.push() calls are correctly implemented. If there's still an issue with navigation, it might be:
1. A runtime error in the target pages
2. Missing data/authentication
3. UI elements not properly triggering the handlers

Recommend testing the application at http://localhost:3001 to identify specific navigation issues.
