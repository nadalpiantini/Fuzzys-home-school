  - Gradient borders based on difficulty
  - Curriculum icons and colors
  - Confidence bars with color coding
  - Reasoning display
  - Metrics badges (score, chapters, streak)
  - "Start Now" action buttons

- **Visual Confidence Indicators:**
  - Green (≥75%): High confidence
  - Blue (50-74%): Medium confidence
  - Orange (<50%): Low confidence

- **Loading States:**
  - Animated brain icon
  - "Fuzzy analyzing..." message

- **Responsive Grid Layout:**
  - 1 column mobile
  - 2 columns tablet
  - 3 columns desktop

### 6. StoryLesson Adaptive Integration
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/lesson/StoryLesson.tsx`

**Features Updated:**
- Added adaptive params to quiz type activities:
  - `adaptive={true}`
  - `studentId={childData?.id}`
  - `curriculumId={curriculum.id}`

**Already had:**
- Adaptive difficulty state management
- Difficulty adjustment logic
- Feedback collection system
- Points and streak integration

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Already Existing)

### Tables Used:
- `chapter_progress`: Stores completion, score, time_spent per chapter
- `student_progress`: Stores total_points, streak_days, last_activity
- `ai_conversations`: Stores feedback and AI interactions
- `family_links`: Parent-student relationships

### Views Used:
- `v_learning_patterns`: Aggregates learning data for AI analysis
- `v_parent_weekly`: Weekly progress for parent dashboards

## 📊 Data Flow
