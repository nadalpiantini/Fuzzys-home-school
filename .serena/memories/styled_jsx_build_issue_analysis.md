# styled-jsx Build Issue Analysis

## Root Cause
styled-jsx v5.1.1 is causing React context errors during SSR when Next.js tries to prerender error pages (404, 500). The StyleRegistry component from styled-jsx tries to use React.useContext but gets null.

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Fixed all TypeScript errors in tRPC routers
2. ❌ Added compiler.styledComponents: false - not the right config
3. ❌ Added webpack alias to disable styled-jsx - still loads during SSR
4. ❌ Created mock module - webpack resolution still finds original

## Current Status
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ PASSING
- Build process: ❌ FAILING on error page prerendering
- Affected pages: /404, /500, /en/404, /en/500, /es/404, /es/500, /student/tutor

## Key Finding
The issue is specifically with SSR prerendering of error pages. The styled-jsx StyleRegistry is being injected by Next.js itself, not by user code (confirmed no <style jsx> usage in codebase).

## Next Approach
Since we can't prevent styled-jsx from loading (it's a Next.js internal dependency), we should:
1. Skip prerendering for error pages
2. Use client-side rendering for these pages
3. Or upgrade/downgrade Next.js to a version without this issue
